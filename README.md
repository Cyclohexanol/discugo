# discugo
Go + Redis + Websocket + Docker

## State of things
No websocket for the moment, nor anything other than a static page...

## Building and running
I use [docker-compose](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-compose). Make sure you have it installed and type in your
terminal from the root of the project:
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
You can then browse to [localhost:7890/anything](localhost:7890/anything).
